# Apple Cider

Smells amazing when it's cooking.



## Ingredients

- 10 Apples - you want more sweet (red) apples than sour (green) apples. Start with a 6:4 ratio and experiment from there.
- 3 Pears - if you find your apple mix to be too sour, increase the amount of pears.
- 1 Orange
- Spices:
  - 6 tsp cinnamon
  - 3 tsp cloves
  - 3 tsp allspice
  - 2 tsp cardamon
  - 1 heaping tsp nutmeg
  - 1/2 cup packed brown sugar



## Tools

- A knife
- 1 stockpot or large pot, capable of holding twice the volume of fruit you have
- Potato masher or similar 
- Strainer
- Wooden spoon
- Pitcher
- Ladle (optional)



## Directions

1. Half the orange and pears. Quarter the apples. Don't bother peeling anything. Rinse out any pests that may have entered into the fruit.
1. Place the fruit and spices into the stockpot and make a note of how far up the sides the fruit comes. Fill the pot with water until the water level is roughly 2 inches above the initial level of the fruit. Do not fill so high that there is any danger of the water boiling over.
1. Bring the water to a boil, then cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 2 hours.
1. Remove and discard the orange halves, then mash the remaining contents of the pot and let simmer, uncovered, for an additional hour.
1. Remove mix from heat and strain into pitcher, using a wooden spoon to press solids through the strainer. It may be helpful to use a ladle to transfer mix into the strainer. If desired, strain a second time to remove any remaining particulates.



## Notes

- Too watery; try cutting fruit into smaller chunks and drastically lowering the amount of water, try to keep it level with the initial amount of fruit.
- Try removing the orange.
