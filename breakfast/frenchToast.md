# French Toast

Classic, flavorful french toast. Nothing too fancy.



## Ingredients

- 2/3 cup milk
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ground cinnamon *
- 1 to 2 tbsp butter
- A pinch of salt
- 6 slices brioche bread

\* "cinnamon you measure with your heart", but 1/2 tsp is a good starting place



## Tools

- Bowl
- Whisk (or fork)
- Pan
- Heat source (stovetop, campfire, gas grill)



## Directions

1. Whisk the milk, egg, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.
1. For each slice of bread, dip the slice into the milk/egg mix until it has soaked into the bread, add some butter to the pan, then lay the bread slice down in the butter and cook until each side is brown, flipping the slice over as needed.
