# Mlyntsi (Crepes)

Probably not what your grandmother would consider "real" mlyntsi, but they're pretty close and easy to make. The ingredients are simple and should be found at any general store, so you can easily make these in the field, too.



## Ingredients

- 2 eggs
- 40 mL (2 tsp + 2 tbsp) sugar
- 1/4 cup (60 mL) flour
- 2/3 cup (120 mL) milk
- 40 mL (2 tsp + 2 tbsp) coconut oil
- Optionally, sour cream, creme fraiche, berries, roasted almonds, or some other topping.



## Tools

- Blender *or* bowl and whisk
- Pan
- Heat source (stovetop, campfire, gas grill)
- Flipper



## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients (except the optional topping) either in a bowl or in the blender, then whisk or blend until homogeneous. 
1. Put a little bit extra oil on the pan. Once the oil is liquid, pour on enough of the mix to coat the pan. Cook for about 2.5 minutes, or until the batter begins to solidify and turns more yellow. Flip (if you haven't done this before, good luck) and cook for an additional 1 minute.
1. Serve with your topping of choice.
