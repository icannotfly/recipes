# Mashed Potatoes



## Ingredients

- 1 lb (450 g) potatoes, Russet or similar
- 1/4 cup (60 mL) butter
- 1/4 cup (60 mL) milk (replace all or some of this with heavy cream, if you'd like)
- Salt and Pepper to taste



## Tools

- Knife 
- Peeler (if available)
- Pot
- Strainer
- Potato Masher



## Directions

1. Peel poatoes and cut into chunks roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) on longest side. Boil until tender, approximately 20 minutes.
1. Drain water, ensuring that none remains (not even a little), and set potatoes aside for a few minutes.
1. Melt butter, taking care to not separate the milkfat from the butter.
1. Heat milk in pot on medium heat until it steams. Reduce heat to low, add potatoes and butter. Mash.
