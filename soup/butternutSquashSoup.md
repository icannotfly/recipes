# Butternut Squash Soup

Tasty.



## Ingredients
- 1 large butternut squash (roughly 3 lbs)
- 1+ tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1.5 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp maple syrup
- a pinch of ground nutmeg
- 3 cups vegetable broth



## Tools
- Cutting board
- Large knife
- Cooking brush
- Pot
- Spoon
- Baking dish
- Oven
- Blender



## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425 &deg;F.
1. While oven is heating, remove the outer skin from the squash and chop it into sections at most 2 in^3. Remove all seeds. Place the chopped squash in the baking dish and brush the sections with olive oil. Add salt and pepper.
1. Roast for 40 - 50 minutes in the oven. Broil for an additional 3 - 5 minutes if desired.
1. While the squash is roasting, dice the shallot and, with 1 tbsp olive oil, fry it in the pot until it begins to brown. Then add the garlic and cook for another minute or two. Remove the pot from heat.
1. When the squash is done roasting and has cooled for 10 - 15 minutes, add it along with the shallot and garlic mix, maple syrup, nutmeg, and vegetable broth into a blender. Do not overfill the blender and take caution when opening the blender.
1. If blending in batches, combine them in the pot. Either way, simmer the soup in the pot until it's time to serve.
